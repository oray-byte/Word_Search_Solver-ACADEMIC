# Word_Search_Solver

## Introduction
This was a program that I built in my first CS course at Missouri S&T. It allows the user to enter a crossword, manually unfortunately, and it enter a word they wish to find. If the program finds the word, it returns a tuple of the starting and ending position (start, end). 

## How it works
This section is under construction. I am screenshotting the code and preparing a nice, in-depth explanation of how this program works.
